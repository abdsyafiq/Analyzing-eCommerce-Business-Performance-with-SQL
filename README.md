# Analyzing eCommerce Business Performance with SQL

This project (mini project) is an additional program in the [Rakamin Academy](https://www.rakamin.com/) bootcamp in the form of a study case designed by an expert from a well-known company with industry standards.

# Introduction

An eCommerce company that connects micro-enterprises with their customers wants to know the company's performance in 2016 - 2018. As a member of the Data Analytics team, I was given the responsibility to analyze three aspects related to the company's business performance, such as:

* **Customer Growth**
* **Product Quality**
* **Payment Type**

The first step is to prepare the database and create a table from the given data using PostgreSQL. After that, I perform queries to display related data from the three aspects mentioned above.

The results of the analysis can be seen [here](https://github.com/abdsyafiq/Analyzing-eCommerce-Business-Performance-with-SQL/blob/master/Analyzing%20eCommerce%20Business%20Performance%20with%20SQL.pdf).
